Code and analysis for the BSc thesis:  
**"Detecting Network Externalities in Preschool Social Networks: Evidence from Inclusive Classrooms"**

## Project Overview

This repository contains all code and visualizations used to reproduce the results presented in the thesis.  
The study examines how structural features shape peer interaction networks in inclusive preschool classrooms.



## Main Notebook

Run the full analysis from preprocessing to figures:  
[`notebook_Bscthesis_network_analysis.ipynb`](notebook_Bscthesis_network_analysis.ipynb)



## Data Source

The interaction data is publicly available via:

**Fasano, R., Irvin, D., & Messinger, D. (2021)**  
"Peer interaction networks in inclusive preschool classrooms"  
*Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research*  
[Dataset link via OSF](https://osf.io/84fwc/?view_only=306f65dcd1144d92b2bc87a185165c25)

This repository does **not** host the dataset directly - users should download it manually and place it in the `data/` folder.



## Methodology

Structural testing is based on simulation methods introduced by:

**Graham, B.S., & Pelican, A. (2020)**  
"Testing for Externalities in Network Formation Using Simulation"  
*The Econometric Analysis of Network Data*

Adapted from their open-source implementation:
